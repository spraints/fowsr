The file is stored in /var/pywws.log, and can be uploaded by calling the script /usr/bin/pywws.sh. The script uses FTP for uploading the log file, so you need a username and password before it is called.

You can then call the script at regular intervals using cron, or call it directly from the command line:

`/usr/bin/pywws.sh <username> <password>`
