 * The application uses the libusb library to read information from the Fine Offset Weather Stations.

 * The cache file `/var/weather.dat` stores the weather station buffer between the reads. Deleting this file causes the application to re-read all weather station data.

 * The log files `/var/*.log` contains the weather station output in the requested format.

 * The script files `/usr/bin/*.sh` contains the weather station upload details.

 * cron is then used to call the requested script files at regular intervals.
