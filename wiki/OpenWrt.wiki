#summary OpenWrt build instructions.

= Introduction =

The *fowsr* application can be built using the OpenWrt build system.


= Details =

== Initial build ==

The *fowsr* application is included as a  [https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/utils/fowsr package] in OpenWrt. A convenient way to get a binary for a particular architecture is to download the OpenWrt build system and generate the binaries as described in this documentation:

http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-390002


A quick guide for generating a build system for *fowsr* includes the following steps:

 * Check the prerequisites for running the OpenWrt build system. You need to have installed subversion, gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex, make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

 * Download the latest OpenWrt trunk:

      `$ svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk kamikaze`

 * Enter the kamikaze catalog:

      `$ cd kamikaze`

 * Include packages in the build: 

      $ `./scripts/feeds update`

 * Add the *fowsr* package to the build

      $ `./scripts/feeds install fowsr`

 * Start the build system and select your architecture:

      $ `make menuconfig`

 * Build the code:

      $ `make`


== Updating the Makefile ==

Perform the following steps if the Makefile in the OpenWrt trunk is out of date:

 * Copy the latest OpenWrt Makefile to the following location in your make system:

`<build directory>/feeds/packages/utils/fowsr/Makefile`

 * Alternatively, update at least the following fields to match the latest Makefile:
   ** `PKG_RELEASE`
   ** `PKG_MD5SUM`

 * Build the updated package:

      $ `make`

The latest OpenWrt Makefile is always available from this location:
