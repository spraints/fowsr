A quick guide includes the following steps:

 * Check the [http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence#table.of.known.prerequisites.and.their.corresponding.packages prerequisites] for running the OpenWrt build system.

 * Download the latest OpenWrt trunk:

      `$ svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk myopenwrt`
      (For download of different releases see [https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/GetSource here].)

 * Enter the openwrt catalog:

      `$ cd myopenwrt`

 * Include packages in the build: 

      $ `./scripts/feeds update`

 * Add the *fowsr* package to the build

      $ `./scripts/feeds install fowsr`

 * Start the build system, select your architecture and activate the *fowsr* module:

      $ `make menuconfig`

 * Build the code:

      $ `make`


== Updating the Makefile ==

Perform the following steps if the Makefile in the OpenWrt trunk is out of date or if you want to use an different (newer) version of *fowsr*:

 * Copy this [http://fowsr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openwrt/Makefile Makefile] to the following location in your OpenWrt build system:

`myopenwrt/feeds/packages/utils/fowsr/Makefile`

 * Alternatively, update at least the following fields to match the appropriate release:
   ** `PKG_VERSION`
   ** `PKG_MD5SUM`

 * Build the updated package:
