#summary OpenWrt build instructions.

= Introduction =

The *fowsr* application is included as a [https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/utils/fowsr package] in [https://openwrt.org/ OpenWrt].

= Details =

== Prebuilt snapshots ==

Prebuilt snapshots for different architectures can be found [http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ here].

The *fowsr* application is found in the packages directory:

`http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/<architecture>/packages/fowsr-<version>`

== Custom build ==

Download the OpenWrt build system and generate the binaries as described in this documentation to make a custom build:

http://kamikaze.openwrt.org/docs/openwrt.html#x1-390002


A quick guide includes the following steps:

 * Check the [http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence#table.of.known.prerequisites.and.their.corresponding.packages prerequisites] for running the OpenWrt build system.

 * Download the latest OpenWrt trunk:

      `$ svn checkout svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk openwrt`

 * Enter the openwrt catalog:

      `$ cd openwrt`

 * Include packages in the build: 

      $ `./scripts/feeds update`

 * Add the *fowsr* package to the build

      $ `./scripts/feeds install fowsr`

 * Start the build system and select your architecture:

      $ `make menuconfig`

 * Build the code:

      $ `make`


== Updating the Makefile ==

Perform the following steps if the Makefile in the OpenWrt trunk is out of date:

 * Copy this [http://fowsr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openwrt/Makefile Makefile] to the following location in your OpenWrt build system:

`<build directory>/feeds/packages/utils/fowsr/Makefile`

 * Alternatively, update at least the following fields to match the latest Makefile:
   ** `PKG_RELEASE`
   ** `PKG_MD5SUM`

 * Build the updated package:

      $ `make`
